Hello lovely friends,

Itâ€™s been a while since weâ€™ve popped into your inbox, and for good reasonâ€”our family grew in December with the arrival of our baby girl J! Between new-parent life and your amazing support keeping orders busier than ever, itâ€™s been a whirlwind few months (a very grateful one!)

This year weâ€™ve also been working on a brand-new website with the wonderful [Chobble](https://chobble.com/?ref=news.southportorganics.co.uk) who we canâ€™t thank enough for making it such a painless and enjoyable experience amidst this chaotic season of life! Itâ€™s still a work in progress on our side, but we canâ€™t wait to launch it fully soon! As ever you can always find us on Etsy too!

With the busiest season fast approaching, weâ€™ve had to make some tough calls and a few product variations and sizes will be discontinued so that we can keep up with the restocks, but rest assuredâ€”your favourites arenâ€™t going anywhere! Every order will continue to be made with care, wrapped with love, and sent from our family to yours.

We miss being more present on social media and in your inboxes, but please know how much your continued support means to us. You truly make this small family business what it is! ðŸ’š

As a thank you please have Â£5 off using code 5OFFAUG via Etsy (minimum spend Â£20) until 1st Sept! Have a lovely rest of this glorious summer, and remember to put some water out for the wildlife!

With love,

Southport Organics ðŸŒ¿

A dreamy Overnight Mask with Lavender, Oat & Hyaluronic Acid.

Let Moonlight Dream hug your skin & soul with soothing hydration and calming aromatherapy. Infused with Organic Oat Glycerin, Organic Shea Butter, Hyaluronic Acid, and dreamy Lavender, this ultra-nourishing mask comforts, repairs, and deeply moisturises, leaving skin soft, smooth, and replenished by morning.

This gorgeously creamy yet fast-absorbing formula is enriched with a powerful blend of antioxidant rich botanical extracts, including Sea Buckthorn, Pomegranate, and Aloe Vera, to protect, restore, and revitalise.

Hyaluronic Acid, a skincare hero loved for its ability to attract and retain up to 1,000 times its weight in water, delivers deep, long-lasting hydration, working to plump, smooth, and lock in moisture as you sleep.
